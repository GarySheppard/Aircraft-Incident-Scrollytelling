# Aircraft Incident Scrollytelling

This is a assignment from my Introduction to Information Visualization course (CS 4460) where I was tasked with creating a scrollytelling representation of aircraft incident data. The assignment presented students with a demonstration of how the final product should look, and it was our responsibility to utilize HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and the D3.js library to produce a comparable scrollytelling experience.

## Run Locally

Install the latest version of node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)

Clone or download the project onto a desired location on your machine

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GarySheppard/Aircraft-Incident-Scrollytelling.git
```

Open the command prompt on your machine (simply type "CMD" in your computer's search bar to find it) and navigate to the directory that you chose for the project using the "cd" command

```bash
  cd C:/path/to/project
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the directory used in the "C:/path/to/project" path is the folder that holds all the project's files

Enter the following command to install the dependencies to host a local server

```bash
  npm install http-server -g
```

Enter the following command to start the local server
